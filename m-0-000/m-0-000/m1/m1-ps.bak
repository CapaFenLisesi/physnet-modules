\noindent Note: Problems~16-19 are used in this module's \textit{Model Exam}.

\begin{two-digit-list}
\item [ 1.] Starting from the definition of the derivative, derive the
expression for the derivative of \m{y = a x^n}, text \Eqnref{B1}.
\item [ 2.] Again working directly from the definition, find the expression
which gives the derivative of \m{f(x)/g(x)} in terms of the derivatives of
\m{f(x)} and \m{g(x)}, text \Eqnref{B3}.
\item [ 3.] Use the chain rule, text \Eqnref{B4}, to determine the derivative of
\m{F(x) = (ax^2+bx+c)^{1/2}}.
\item [ 4.] Show that the derivative with respect to \m{\theta} of \m{\tan\theta}
is \m{\sec^2\theta}, given the derivatives of the sine and cosine.
\item [ 5.] Given the derivative of \m{\ell n\,x}, text \Eqnref{B16}, determine the
expression for the derivative of \m{e^x}, simplified text \Eqnref{B18}.
\item [ 6.] Evaluate the derivative of \m{(x^2+7x+2)/(x+2)} at \m{x = 1}.
\item [ 7.] Evaluate the derivative of \m{e^{5x}(x^2+5x-7)} at \m{x = 0.2}.
\item [ 8.] Show that the derivative of \m{-\csc(4\theta-1)} is
\m{4[\csc(4\theta-1)][\cot(4\theta-1)]}, given the derivatives of sine
and cosine.
\item [ 9.] Show that the slope of the function \m{y(x) = 2x^3-3x^2+4}
at \m{x = -1} is \m{+12}.
\item [10.] For the function in problem~9, show that the slope at \m{x = 1/3}
is \m{-4/3}.
\item [11.] For the function in problem~9, show that the locations of the
maximum and minimum are, respectively, (0,4) and (1,3).
With the aid of these results, sketch a graph of the function.
\item [12.] Referring to Appendix~B, show that the integral
%
\Eqn{}{\int\left[Y(x)\dfrac{dZ(x)}{dx} + Z(x)\dfrac{dY(x)}{dx}\right]\;dx}
%
is: \m{Y(x)Z(x) + C}.
\item [13.] Evaluate the integral of \m{6 x^2 - 2} and show that, if at \m{x = 2} the
integral is to have the value \m{10}, then the integral's arbitrary constant is
determined and the integral is \m{2(x^3 - x - 1)}.
\item [14.] Evaluate this definite integral: \m{\int_{-2}^{+2}\;(5x^2+x)\,dx}\,.
\item [15.] A function \m{y(x)} has these properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item [(i)] it is zero for all values of \m{x} up to \m{x = 5}, at which point it has
the value \m{y = 10}.
\item [(ii)] from \m{x = 5} to \m{x = 20} the function falls linearly (as a
straight line) to zero, after which it is zero for all higher values of \m{x}.
\end{itemize}
Sketch the function and evaluate its integral in the interval \m{x = 0} to
\m{x = 50}.
(Hint: Make use of the geometrical interpretation of the integral.)
\item [16.] Verify that \m{f(t) = A \cos\omega t + B \sin\omega t} (where \m{A}
and \m{B} are constant and \m{\omega^2 = k/m}) is a solution of
%
\Eqn{}{m \dfrac{d^2 f(t)}{dt^2} + k f(t) = 0\,,}
%
where \m{d^2 f(t)/dt^2} is the second derivative of \m{f(t)} and \m{k} and \m{m} are
constants.
\item [17.] Evaluate the derivative of \m{(A \cos 5y)} at \m{y = \pi/20}.
\item [18.] Evaluate this integral: \m{\int x^{1/2}\,dx}\,.
\item [19.] For each of the equations below, find the maximum and/or minimum
points and distinguish between them.
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] \m{y(x) = x^2 + x + 10}.
\item [b.] \m{y(x) = x^3 - 3x + 2}.
\item [c.] Determine \m{A}, \m{B} and \m{C} so the function \m{y(x) = Ax^3 + B x^2 + C} will
have a minimum at \m{x = 1/3}.
