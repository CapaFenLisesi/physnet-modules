\begin{KnowledgeSkills}
\item [K1.] In two dimensions, add any number of given vectors graphically.
\item [K2.] Given a vector's components in two dimensions, determine the
magnitude of the vector and the angle it makes with each of the two coordinate
axes, and conversely.
\item [K3.] In three dimensions, add and subtract given vectors expressed as
(a) a triad of components and (b) in terms of unit vectors along the coordinate
axes.
\item [K4.] Evaluate the scalar product of two given vectors, both in terms of
the vectors' components along a fixed set of axes and in terms of the vectors'
magnitudes and the angle between them.
\item [K5.] Evaluate the magnitude of the vector product of two given vectors
in terms of: their magnitudes and the angle between them.
Determine the direction by either the right-hand rule or the screw rule.
\item [K6.] Determine the vector product of two vectors, using their given
components along a set of Cartesian coordinate axes.
