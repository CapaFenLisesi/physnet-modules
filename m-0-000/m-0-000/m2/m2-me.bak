\begin{two-digit-list}
\item [1.] See Output Skills K1-K6 in this module's {\it ID Sheet}.
One or more of these skills, or none, may be on the actual exam.

\item [2.] A vector $\vec{R}$ has its tail at the origin and its head at the
point (2,\,5,\,-3).
Another vector $\vec{S}$ has its tail also at the origin, while its head is at
the point (2,\,-5,\,0).
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] What is the length of the vector $\vec{R}$ + $\vec{S}$?
\item [b.] What is the length of the vector $\vec{S}$ - $\vec{R}$?
\item [c.] What is the length of the vector $\vec{R}$?
\end{one-digit-list}

\item [3.] Vector $\vec{T}$ is 4 units long and directed along the $x$-axis.
Vector $\vec{V}$ is 6 units long and is directed along the $z$-axis.
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] What is the direction of the vector $\vec{T} \times \vec{V}$?
\item [b.] What is the magnitude of the vector $\vec{T} \times \vec{V}$?
\item [c.] Express $\vec{T} \times \vec{V}$ in terms of the unit vectors along
the coordinate axes.
\end{one-digit-list}

\item [4.] Evaluate:
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] $\hat{x} \times \hat{z}$
\item [b.] $\hat{y} \cdot  \hat{z}$
\item [c.] $\hat{z} \times \hat{z}$
\item [d.] $\uvex{y} \times \uvex{z}$
\item [e.] $\uvex{x} \cdot  \uvex{x}$
\item [f.] $\uvex{x} \times \uvex{y}$
