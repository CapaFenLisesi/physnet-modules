\begin{two-digit-list}
\item [1.] See Output Skills K1-K6 in this module's \textit{ID Sheet}.
One or more of these skills, or none, may be on the actual exam.

\item [2.] A vector \vect{R} has its tail at the origin and its head at the
point (2,\,5,\,-3).
Another vector \vect{S} has its tail also at the origin, while its head is at
the point (2,\,-5,\,0).
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] What is the length of the vector \vect{R} + \vect{S}?
\item [b.] What is the length of the vector \vect{S} - \vect{R}?
\item [c.] What is the length of the vector \vect{R}?
\end{one-digit-list}

\item [3.] Vector \vect{T} is 4\unit{units} long and directed along the \m{x}-axis.
Vector \vect{V} is 6\unit{units} long and is directed along the \m{z}-axis.
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] What is the direction of the vector \m{\vect{T} \times \vect{V}}?
\item [b.] What is the magnitude of the vector \m{\vect{T} \times \vect{V}}?
\item [c.] Express \m{\vect{T} \times \vect{V}} in terms of the unit vectors along
the coordinate axes.

\item [4.] Evaluate:
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] \m{\uvec{x} \times \uvec{z}}
\item [b.] \m{\uvec{y} \cdot  \uvec{z}}
