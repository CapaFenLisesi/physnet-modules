\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [1.] Verify that \m{f(t) = A \cos\omega t + B \sin\omega t} (where \m{A} and
\m{B} are constant and \m{\omega^2 = k/m}) is a solution of
\begin{displaymath}
m \dfrac{d^2 f(t)}{dt^2} + k f(t) = 0
\end{displaymath}
where \m{d^2 f(t)/dt^2} is the second derivative of \m{f(t)} and \m{k} and \m{m} are
constants.
\item [2.] Evaluate the derivative of \m{(A \cos 5y)} at \m{y = \pi/20}.
\item [3.] Evaluate these integrals:
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] \m{\int A r e^{kr}\,dr} \qquad (\m{A} and \m{k} are constants)
\item [b.] \m{\int x^{1/2}\,dx}
\end{one-digit-list}

\item [4.] For each of the equations below, find the maximum and/or minimum
points and distinguish between them.
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] \m{y(x) = x^2 + x + 10}.
\item [b.] \m{y(x) = x^3 - 3x + 2}.
\item [c.] Determine \m{A}, \m{B} and \m{C} so the function \m{Ax^3 + B x^2 + C} will
have a minimum at (1/3,0) and a maximum at (0,1).
