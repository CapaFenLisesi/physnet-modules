    \begin{KnowledgeSkills}
    \item [K1.] Distinguish a set of concurrent forces from a set of
    nonconcurrent ones.
    \item [K2.] State the equilibrium condition for an object which is acted
    upon by a set of concurrent forces.

    \begin{ProblemSolvingSkills}
    \item [S1.] Given an object in static equilibrium and its environment,
    determine the forces that act on the object and draw a one-body force
    diagram (\Quote{free-body diagram}) indicating these forces.
    \item [S2.] Using the force diagram for an object, apply the conditions for
    static equilibrium to determine the unknown magnitudes and/or directions of
    forces in a set of concurrent forces.
