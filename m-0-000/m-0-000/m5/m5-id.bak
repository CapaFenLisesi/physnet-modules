\begin{InputSkills}
\item [1.]  Given two or more forces, find their vector sum \prrqone{0-14}.
\item [2.]  Resolve any force into perpendicular components \prrqone{0-72}.
\item [3.]  Evaluate the vector product of two vectors \prrqone{0-2}.
\item [4.]  State the relationship between torque and angular acceleration
\prrqone{0-33}.
\item [5.]  State the relationship between force and acceleration
specifically including contact forces \prrqone{0-16}.
\end{InputSkills}

\begin{KnowledgeSkills}
\item [K1.] Distinguish a set of concurrent forces from a set of
nonconcurrent ones.
\item [K2.] State the equilibrium condition for an object which is acted
upon by a set of concurrent forces.
\end{KnowledgeSkills}

\begin{ProblemSolvingSkills}
\item [S1.] Given an object in static equilibrium and its environment,
determine the forces that act on the object and draw a one-body force
diagram (``free-body diagram'') indicating these forces.
\item [S2.] Using the force diagram for an object, apply the conditions for
static equilibrium to determine the unknown magnitudes and/or directions of
forces in a set of concurrent forces.
