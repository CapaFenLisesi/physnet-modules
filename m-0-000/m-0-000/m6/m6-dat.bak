    \begin{KnowledgeSkills}
    \item [K1.] State the equilibrium conditions for an extended object that is acted
    upon by any set of forces, concurrent or non-concurrent.
    \item [K2.] Define the center of gravity of an object.
    \item [K3.] Define the center of mass of a system of point particles or of an object.
    \end{KnowledgeSkills}

    \begin{ProblemSolvingSkills}
    \item [S1.] Starting with the force diagram for an extended body use the conditions
    for static equilibrium to determine the magnitude and/or direction of some
    unknown forces on the body when the other forces are given.
    \item [S2.] Calculate the location of the center of mass of a given system of point
    masses.
    \item [S3.] Extend S2 to include systems of discrete extended masses having known
    centers of mass.
    \item [S4.] Given a mass density and a simple geometrical shape for a continuous
    object, locate the center of mass of the object using integration.
