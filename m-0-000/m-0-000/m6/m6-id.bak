\begin{InputSkills}
\item [1.]  Integrate functions \prrqone{0-1}.
\item [2.]  Add and multiply vectors \prrqone{0-2}.
\item [3.]  State the equilibrium condition for an object acted on by a set of
concurrent forces \prrqone{0-5}.
\item [4.] Define torque \prrqone{0-5}.
\end{InputSkills}

\begin{KnowledgeSkills}
\item [K1.] State the equilibrium conditions for an extended object that is acted
upon by any set of forces, concurrent or non-concurrent.
\item [K2.] Define the center of force.
\item [K3.] Define the center of gravity of an object.
\item [K4.] Define the center of mass of a system.
\end{KnowledgeSkills}

\begin{ProblemSolvingSkills}
\item [S1.] Calculate the center of force for a given set of parallel forces acting
on a rigid body.
\item [S2.] Starting with the force diagram for an extended body use the conditions
for static equilibrium to determine the magnitude and/or direction of some
unknown forces on the body when the other forces are given.
\item [S3.] Calculate the location of the center of mass of a given system of point
masses.
\item [S4.] Extend S3 to include systems of discrete extended masses having known
centers of mass.
\item [S5.] Given a mass density and a simple geometrical shape for a continuous
object, locate the center of mass of the object using integration.
