{The two referenced equations each contain the \textit{symbol} that you are
 being asked to eliminate.
 Label either one of the equations \#1, the other \#2.
 Solve equation~\#1 for the \textit{symbol}.
 You end up with:
 %
 \begin{center}\textit{symbol = some stuff}.\end{center}
 %
 Now, everywhere that the \textit{symbol} occurs in equation~\#2 you must
 replace it with the \textit{some stuff}.
 Because you substituted for it, the \textit{symbol} is gone from the
 equation.

 If necessary, solve the resulting equation for whatever is of interest.

{Here is the calculus derivation, which starts with the rule for finding the average of any quantity:
%
\Eqn{}{\overline{v} = \dfrac{\int_{t_o}^{t_f} v(t)\,dt}{\int_{t_o}^{t_f} \,dt} =
       \dfrac{\int_{t_o}^{t_f} [dx(t)/dt]\,dt}{\int_{t_o}^{t_f} \,dt} =
       \dfrac{\int_{t_o}^{t_f} dx(t)}{\int_{t_o}^{t_f} \,dt} =
       \dfrac{x(t_f) - x(t_o)}{t_f - t_o} = \dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}.}
