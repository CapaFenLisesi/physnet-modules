\BlackTriangle If you get really stuck on a problem, turn to the appropriate
hint in this module's {\it Special Assistance Supplement} and then try to
continue with the solution.
For example, problem 1a, below, has a hint in the box labeled [S-1] in
the {\it Special Assistance Supplement}.
If you still can't solve problem 1a after using the hint, the [S-1] box
contains a reference to another box containing a further hint.

\BlackTriangle Problems 11, 13-15 also occur in this module's {\it Model Exam}.

\item [b.] $\vec{a}(20\,{\rm s}) = (dv_x/dt) \uvex{x} + (dv_y/dt) \uvex{y}$.
\newline
Using the fact that the derivative of a straight line is the slope
of the line,
$\vec{a}(20\,{\rm s}) = \left[- (1/2) \uvex{x} - \uvex{y}\right]\,{\rm m/s}^2$

\vec{v}(20\,{\rm s})\right]/\,\left[60\,{\rm s} - 20\,{\rm s}\right]$\newline
$\vec{v}$ at $t = 60$\,s is (from the graph) $(10 \uvex{x} - 20 \uvex{y})$\,m/s.
\newline
$\vec{v}$ at $t = 20$\,s is $(10 \uvex{x} + 0 \uvex{y})$\,m/s.\newline
$\vec{a}_{av} = - (1/2) \uvex{y}$\,m/s$^2$.

The time of descent is given by putting $y = 300$\,m, and solving
for $t$: $t = 37.5$\,s.
The displacement is obtained by putting $t = 37.5$\,s into
the equation for $x$: $x = 112.5$\,m\,south.

$\phantom{\vec{v}(t)} = \uvex{x} \int_0^t A\,dt' + \uvex{y} \int_0^t B\,dt' + 0$

$\phantom{\vec{v}(t)} = A t \uvex{x} + B t \uvex{y} = (A \uvex{x} + B \uvex{y}) t$

$\vec{v}_{av} = \fract{\int_0^t \vec{v}(t')\,dt'}{t - 0}$

$\phantom{\vec{v}} = \fract{\uvex{x}}{t}\left(\fract{1}{2} A t^2 \right) +
\fract{\uvex{y}}{t} \left( \fract{1}{2} B t^2 \right)$

$\phantom{\vec{v}} = \fract{1}{2}(A \uvex{x} + B \uvex{y}) t =
\fract{1}{2} \vec{v}(t)$

This is a very special result that holds true only for constant acceleration
from rest.
Any other set of conditions must be treated by the above method to find any
special relation between $\vec{v}_{av}$ and $\vec{v}(t)$.

\item [10.] Choose a coordinate system with axes parallel and perpendicular to
the inclined surface.
Choose this coordinate system because then it is easy to
state the mathematical condition corresponding to the ball hitting the
incline: it is when (again) $y = 0$.
In such a system the acceleration of the ball, the acceleration of gravity,
is: $\vec{a} = \vec{g} = - g \sin30\degrees \uvex{x} - g \cos30\degrees \uvex{y}$.
\help{41}\newline
Using the equations for constant acceleration (the origin is at the boy):
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_x & = & - g \sin30\degrees \\
v_x & = & - g \sin30\degrees t - v_0 \cos30\degrees \\

y   & = & - (g/2) \cos30\degrees t^2 + v_0 \sin30\degrees t
\end{eqnarray*}
Putting $y = 0$ and solving for $t$ gives two solutions:
either $t = 0$ or $t = 1.18$\,s.
There are two times when the ball is at $y = 0$: when it is released and when
it strikes the surface.
The time in question is $t = 1.18$\,s.
