 \m{\uvec{r}} is a unit vector.

 (1) \m{ | \uvec{\theta} | = 0}; or (2) \m{ | \uvec{r} | = 0};
 or (3) they are perpendicular.
 Choices (1) and (2) are obviously false so (3) must be true.

{You are given \vect{v} and are asked about \m{\vect{v} + \Delta \vect{v}}

{The direction of \m{\vect{\omega} \times \vect{r}}, by definition of the
 vector product, must be perpendicular to \vect{\omega}.
 Therefore this vector product lies in the plane of motion.
 It must also be perpendicular to \vect{r}; therefore it lies along the
 tangent.
 Using the right hand rule, the product points in the direction of the
 tangential velocity.
 Since \vect{\omega} and \vect{r} are perpendicular, the magnitude of
 \m{\vect{\omega} \times \vect{r}} is just \m{\omega\,r}.
 This, in turn, is just the magnitude of the tangential velocity, \m{v}.

 Here is another equivalent one: \m{\theta/360\degrees = s/(2 \pi r)}.}

{The car's speed is 50\unit{mph} only at the quoted instant of time.
 Slightly earlier in time its speed was less than that, and slightly later
 its speed will be greater.
 Therefore it has tangential acceleration.
 Because it is in circular motion, it also has radial acceleration.

{The \Quote{second} hand makes one complete circuit of the dial in one minute,
 which is 60\unit{seconds}, so its period is: \m{T = 60\unit{sec}}.
 Now convert this to frequency.

 The \Quote{hour} hand makes one complete circuit of the dial in 12\unit{hours}, which

{To get the direction of motion (CW or CCW), use the values of the components of the radius and velocity
vectors to either draw the velocity vector in your head or to sketch it on a piece of paper (see the
velocity vectors sketched throughout the text of this module).  To get the direction of the acceleration,
do the same with the radius and acceleration vectors.  In each case the radius vector is said to be needed
only in order to get the correct angle for the unit vectors.
