    \begin{InputSkills}
    %
    \item [1.] Define kinematically: velocity, speed, and acceleration
    \prrqone{0-7}, \prrqone{0-8}.
    %
    \item [2.] Use the Cartesian unit vectors \m{\uvec{x}}, \m{\uvec{y}}, \m{\uvec{z}}
    to write a vector in terms of its Cartesian components \prrqone{0-1},
    \prrqone{0-2}.
    %
    \item [3.] Use the chain rule to differentiate sine and cosine \prrqone{0-1},
    \prrqone{0-2}.
    %
    \item [4.] Given the position, velocity, and acceleration vectors for a
    particle executing circular motion, determine: (1) if the motion is
    clockwise or counterclockwise; and (2) if the particle's speed is
    increasing, decreasing or unchanging \prrqone{0-72}.
    %
    \item [5.] Given a particle's position on a circle, its direction
    of motion as clockwise or counterclockwise, and whether its speed is
    increasing, decreasing, or unchanging, draw plausible position, velocity,
    and acceleration vectors with correct spatial orientations \prrqone{0-72}.

    \begin{KnowledgeSkills}
    \item [K1.] Define angular velocity in terms of angular displacement and
    explain how to determine the direction of the angular velocity vector.
    \end{KnowledgeSkills}
    %
    \begin{RuleApplicationSkills}
    \item [R1.] A particle is moving along a circular path.  Given the radius of the
    circle and the particle's position as measured along the arc of its path as a function
    of time, formally calculate its position, velocity, and acceleration vectors at any instant.
    %
    \item [R2.] A particle in uniform circular motion has these four
    descriptors: radius, speed, radial acceleration (magnitude), plus either of
    period or frequency. Given any two of these quantities, determine the other
    two.
