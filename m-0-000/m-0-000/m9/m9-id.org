\item Title: {\bf CIRCULAR MOTION: KINEMATICS}

\item Author: James M.~Tanner, School of Physics, Georgia Inst.~of Tech.,
Atlanta, GA  30332

\item Version: 9/2/94 \hfil Evaluation: Stage 0

\item Length: 1 hr., TX(11 pp.), PS(4 pp.), AS(4 pp.), ME(2 pp.).

\item {\bf Input Skills}:

\begin{id-subitems}
\item [1.] Define kinematically: velocity, speed, and acceleration (MISN-0-7),
(MISN-0-8).

\item [2.] Use the Cartesian unit vectors $\hat{x}$, $\hat{y}$, $\hat{z}$ to write a
vector in terms of its Cartesian components (MISN-0-1), (MISN-0-2).

\item [3.] Use the chain rule to differentiate sine and cosine (MISN-0-1), (MISN-0-2).

\item [4.] Given the position, velocity, and acceleration vectors for a particle
executing circular motion, determine: (1) if the motion is clockwise or
counterclockwise; and (2) if the particle's speed is increasing, decreasing
or unchanging (MISN-0-72).

\item [5.] Given: (1) a particle's position on a circle; (2) its direction of motion
as clockwise or counterclockwise: and (3) its change of speed as
increasing, decreasing, or unchanging.
Draw plausible position, velocity, and acceleration vectors with correct spatial
orientations (MISN-0-72).
\end{id-subitems}

\item {\bf Output Skills (Knowledge)}:
\begin{id-subitems}
\item [K1.] Define angular velocity in terms of angular displacement and explain
how to determine the direction of the angular velocity vector.
\end{id-subitems}

\item {\bf Output Skills (Rule Application)}:
\begin{id-subitems}
\item [R1.] Given a particle's position (as measured along the arc of its circular
path) as a function of time, formally calculate its position, velocity, and
acceleration vectors at any instant.

\item [R2.] A particle in uniform circular motion has these four descriptors: radius,
speed, radial acceleration (magnitude), plus either of period or frequency.
Given any two of these quantities, determine the other two.
