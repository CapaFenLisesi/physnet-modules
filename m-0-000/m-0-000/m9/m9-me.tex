\item [1.] See Output Skill K1 in this module's \textit{ID Sheet}, just inside
the cover.
\item [2.] A particle moves CCW on a circle of radius \m{r = 4.0\unit{m}}.
Its trajectory position \m{s} along the circular arc is given by:
%
\Eqn{}{s(t) = (8.0\unit{m/s}) t - (1.00\unit{m/s\up{2}}) t^2\,.}
%
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] Determine the particle's position \vect{r}, velocity \vect{v},
and acceleration \vect{a} at \m{t = 2.0\unit{s}}.
Sketch \vect{r}, \vect{v}, and \vect{a} at this time.
\item [b.] Determine if the motion of the particle is clockwise or 
counterclockwise at \m{t = 2.0\unit{s}}, and whether the particle's speed is
increasing or decreasing at that time.
\end{one-digit-list}

\item [3.] Calculate the speed and acceleration of a person on the equator 
resulting from the earth's spinning about its axis through the poles.
The earth's mean radius is \m{6.37 \times 10^6\unit{m}}.
