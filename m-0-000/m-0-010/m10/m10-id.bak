\begin{InputSkills}
\item [1.]  State Newton's laws of motion and apply them to problems
involving constant forces acting on one particle traveling in one
dimension \prrqone{0-14}, \prrqone{0-15}.
\end{InputSkills}

\begin{KnowledgeSkills}
\item [K1.] Vocabulary: contact force, non-contact force, surface force,
            resultant force.
\end{KnowledgeSkills}

\begin{RuleApplicationSkills}
\item [R1.] Given a non-rotating object on a linear trajectory, or two
such objects connected by a string or rope, possibly over a pulley,
and given the information on the acceleration of the object and all
forces except a surface force, determine the magnitude and direction
of the surface force:
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] Draw a one-body diagram for each object showing the given
forces acting on the object, with each force clearly labeled.
Resolve those forces into components with one axis along the direction
of acceleration and draw those components on another one-body force
diagram.
\item [b.] Write Newton's second law in component form for the known
forces and the resultant force.
\item [c.] Solve for the unknown surface force and add it the the
original one-body force diagram.
