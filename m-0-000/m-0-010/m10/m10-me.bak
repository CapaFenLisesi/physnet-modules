\textbf{Important Note:} Make each problem have these three separate parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item [a.] draw a one-body diagram with the forces ``as given'';
\item [b.] draw a diagram similar to the one in part (a), but with the forces now
represented only by their components, where one axis is along the direction of
acceleration and the axes are labeled;
\item [c.] write Newton's-second-law equations for the force
           components and solve for the components of the unknown force.
           Convert the answer components to magnitude and angle to the
           acceleration direction.''
\end{itemize}

At the particular instant illustrated, the acceleration of the plane is
24\,ft/sec$^2$ and is parallel to the direction of the velocity.
