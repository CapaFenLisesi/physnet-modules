Use double subscripts and proper units wherever possible.

\item [1.] See Output Skill K1, this module's {ID Sheet}.

\item [2.] You are a small-craft airplane pilot.
You have pointed your plane due west and maintained a speed of 120\unit{mi/hr}
as registered on your air-speed indicator (speed with respect to the air)
for two hours.
However, there is a wind blowing out of the north-east at 40\unit{mi/hr}.
Calculate the distance you are off your due-west course.

\item [3.] Relative to the origin of a laboratory reference frame \m{L}, an
object \m{A}'s position varies with time according to
%
\Eqn{}{\uvec{r}_A = 5 t^2 \uvec{x} + 8 \uvec{y}\,,}
%
while an observer \m{O} sees
%
\Eqn{}{\uvec{r}_A = 7 t^2 \uvec{x} - 3 t^{-1} \uvec{z}\,.}
%
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] Rewrite the above vector equations, putting in double subscripts
and proper units.
Assume that distance is measured in meters and time in hours.
\item [b.] Find the speed (magnitude of the velocity) of \m{O} relative to \m{L}
at time \m{t}.
\item [c.] Find the magnitude of the acceleration of \m{O} relative to \m{L} at
time \m{t}.
\item [d.] Draw a rough sketch of the position and velocity vectors of \m{O},
as seen by \m{L} at \m{t = 90\unit{min}}, as they would appear looking down the
\m{z}-axis toward the origin.
