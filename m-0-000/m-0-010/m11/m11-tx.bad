1. APPLICATIONS OF RELATIVE MOTION__________________________________

1a. Navigation______________
.PA
An application of relative motion which immediately comes to mind is that of
navigation through currents of water and air.
Consider two observers and an object, where each observer sees both the
other observer and the object as moving.
Given the equation of motion of the object as seen by one observer, what
equation of motion will the other observer see for it?
Here the equation of motion set by the pilot, with respect to the fluid
through which he moves, must be such as to produce the correct equation of
motion with respect to the land.
Can you tell which are the two "observers" and which is the "object?"\  \Can
you transform the desired land-based equation into the fluid-based one needed
for navigation?

For another application, consider the apparent motions of the planets across
the night sky.
Since very ancient times, the positions of the planets at various times had
been carefully recorded.
In about 140 A.D., from this vast set of numbers, the planetary equations of
motion were finally deduced by Ptolemy.
These equations were so excruciatingly complicated, however, that the forces
which would produce them must have seemed incomprehensible.
Then in 1543, in what must have been one of the most thrilling discoveries
in history, Copernicus transformed the equations of motion to the way they
would be observed from the sun and thereupon found them to be trivially
simple.
This eventually spurred Newton to discover the elegantly simple universal
laws of motion and of gravitation, and to invent calculus.
From that day to this, a fundamental assumption of physicists has been that
all of the forces of nature will be found to be elegantly simple when
properly expressed.

2. THE DOUBLE SUBSCRIPT NOTATION________________________________

.PA
Double subscript notation is a simple and consistent method of dealing with
.NR A 25

.BC

.EC
the relative positions of two objects.
If rTA is the position vector of object A and rTB is the position vector of
object B in a given coordinate system, then the position vector of B relative
to A is defined by
.SP
.EQ ''rTBA = rTB - rTA.'(1)'
.SP 2
Notice that rTBA is the vector which, when added to rTA, gives rTB:
.SP
.EQ ''rTA + rTBA = rTB .'(2)'
.SP 2
That is, if you start at the position of object A, and move along rTBA,
you end up at the position of object B (see Fig.1).
.PC
2b. The Order of the Subscripts_______________________________
.PA
The order of the subscripts of a relative position vector determines the
direction of the vector.
The vector rTBA is directed from object A to object B.
The vector rTAB, from B to A, would obviously point in the opposite direction,
and have exactly the same length as rTBA , so
.SP
.EQ''rTAB = -rTBA.'(3)'

2c. Velocity and Acceleration from Relative Position____________________________________________________
.PA
Once the relative position has been determined, it is simple to get the
velocity and acceleration of B relative to A, just by differentiating
Eq.(1):
.SP 3
.EQ''vTBA = dt__d (rTBA) = dt__d (rTB-rTA) = dt__d rTB- dt__d rTA = vTB-vTA''

.SP 3
so
.BR
.EQ''vTBA = vTB - vTA ,'(4)'
.SP 2
.EQ''aTBA = aTB - aTA .'(5)'
.SP 2
Notice that the mathematical relationships between vTBA, vTA, and vTB, and
between aTBA, aTA, and aTB are identical to those between rTBA, rTA, rTB.
For example, if you start out having velocity vTA (or acceleration aTA),
give yourself the additional velocity vTBA (or acceleration aTBA), you end up
having velocity vTB (or acceleration aTB).

2d. Subscript Reversal on vT and aT_________________________________
.PA
It is also easy to see that the velocity of A relative to B, vTAB, and the
acceleration of A relative to B, aTAB, are related to vTBA and aTBA in just the
same way as rTAB is related to rTBA:
.SP 2
.EQ''vTAB = -vTBA ,'(6)'

.EQ''aTAB = -aTBA .'(7)'

Sometimes it may be easier to deal solely with relative quantities like rTAB
instead of "absolute" ones like rTA.
To do this, we can simply place an observer O at the origin of our
coordinate system and measure all the vector quantities relative to that
observer.
Thus rTA becomes rTAO, vTA becomes vTAO, and so on (see Fig.2a).
Equation(1) then becomes
.SP 2
.EQ''rTBA = rTBO - rTAO'(8)'
.SP 2
or, by applying Eq.(3) to get rTAO=-rTOA (see Fig.2b), we have
.SP 2
.EQ''rTBA = rTOA + rTBO .'(9)'

3b. Checking an Equation's Subscript Sequence_____________________________________________
.PA
The addition equation, Eq.(9), may be read "A to B equals A to O plus O to
B."\ 
Note that one reads the subscripts from right to left.
This provides a powerful check on the correctness of relative-vector
equations, since it is usually quite easy to rearrange terms into the
addition form.
.PC
3c. Converting From Other Notations___________________________________
.PA
Many scientists use a "prime-unprime" notation when describing vectors
relative to two frames of reference.
Vectors in that notation may be converted to double subscript notation by
placing observers (say, O and O') at the origins of the reference frames and
expressing the vector quantities relative to these observers.
For example, consider the "prime-unprime" velocity addition equation
.SP
.EQ ""  vT = vT'+ uT"(10)"
.SP
where vT is the velocity of an object in the unprimed reference frame, vT'is
the velocity of the object in the primed reference frame, and 
uT is the velocity of the primed frame relative to unprimed frame.
Equation(10) can be rewritten as
.SP 2
.EQ ""vTAO = vTAO' + vTO'O"(11)"
.SP 2
by making the identifications
.SP
    vT = vTAO  = velocity of A relative to O,
.SP
   vT' = vTAO' = velocity of A relative to O', and
.SP
    uT = vTO'O = velocity of O' relative to O.
.SP 2
The double subscript form is easy to check visually.

.PA
To determine the motion of a particle 
The equation of motion for a particle is given by the vector relation
.SP 2
.EQ ''aT = dvT__dt ,
.SP 2
which is actually three component equations expressed in mathematical
shorthand.

.PC
4b. Conditions for a=dv/dt___________________________
.PA
The scalar equation a=dv/dt holds, in two and three dimensions, only when
either: (i) v=0; or (ii) dv^/dt=0.
Thus either the speed must be instantaneously zero or the direction of the
velocity must be constant.
The latter condition specifies that the motion must be linear, i.e. along a
straight line.
.PC
4c. Derivation of the Conditions________________________________
.PA
Let vT=vv^  where v is the magnitude of vT and v^ is its directional unit
vector, |v^|=1.
Then:
.SP
.EQ''a = |aT| = |d(vT)/dt| = |d(vv^)/dt|   '(12)'
.SP
.EQ''        = |v^dv/dt + vdv^/dt|       '(13)'
.SP
where we have taken the derivative of a product.
Hence if either v=0 or dv^/dt=0 (the result dv^/dt=0 means that the
direction of v^ does not change with time), then
.SP
.EQ''a = |v^dv/dt| = |v^|^|dv/dt| = dv__dt'(13)'
.SP
and a=dv/dt holds as a non-vector equation.
