\mTitle{RELATIVE LINEAR MOTION AND FRAMES~OF~REFERENCE}

\mAuthor{Peter Signell and William C. Lane, Department of Physics}

\scap{1}{APPLICATIONS OF RELATIVE MOTION}

\pcap{1}{a}{Navigation}
An application of relative motion which immediately comes to mind is that of
navigation through currents of water and air.
Consider two observers and an object, where each observer sees both the
other observer and the object as moving.
Given the equation of motion of the object as seen by one observer, what
equation of motion will the other observer see for it?
Here the equation of motion set by the pilot, with respect to the fluid
through which he moves, must be such as to produce the correct equation of
motion with respect to the land.
Can you tell which are the two ``observers'' and which is the ``object?''
Can you transform the desired land-based equation into the fluid-based one
needed for navigation?

\pcap{1}{b}{Solar System Dynamics}
For another application, consider the apparent motions of the planets across
the night sky.
Since very ancient times, the positions of the planets at various times had
been carefully recorded.
In about 140 A.D., from this vast set of numbers, the planetary equations of
motion were finally deduced by Ptolemy.
These equations were so excruciatingly complicated, however, that the forces
which would produce them must have seemed incomprehensible.
Then in 1543, in what must have been one of the most thrilling discoveries
in history, Copernicus transformed the equations of motion to the way they
would be observed from the sun and thereupon found them to be trivially
simple.
This eventually spurred Newton to discover the elegantly simple universal
laws of motion and of gravitation, and to invent calculus.
From that day to this, a fundamental assumption of physicists has been that
all of the forces of nature will be found to be elegantly simple when
properly expressed.

\scap{2}{DOUBLE SUBSCRIPT NOTATION}

\pcap{2}{a}{Relative Position Vectors}
Double subscript notation is a simple and consistent method of dealing with
the relative positions of two objects.
If $\vec{r}_A$ is the position vector of object $A$ and $\vec{r}_B$ is the
position vector of object $B$ in a given coordinate system, then the
position vector of $B$ relative to $A$ is defined by
%
\eqn{1}{\vec{r}_{BA} = \vec{r}_B - \vec{r}_A\,.}
%
Notice that $\vec{r}_{BA}$ is the vector which, when added to $\vec{r}_A$,
gives $\vec{r}_B$:
%
\eqn{2}{\vec{r}_A + \vec{r}_{BA} = \vec{r}_B\,.}
%
That is, if you start at the position of object $A$, and move along
$\vec{r}_{BA}$, you end up at the position of object $B$ (see Fig.\,1).

\CaptionAfterLeftFigure{Fig.\,1. Vector interpretation of double subscript
notation.}{m11gr01}

\pcap{2}{b}{The Order of the Subscripts}
The order of the subscripts of a relative position vector determines the
direction of the vector.
The vector $\vec{r}_{BA}$ is directed from object $A$ to object $B$.
The vector $\vec{r}_{AB}$, from $B$ to $A$, would obviously point in the
opposite direction, and have exactly the same length as $\vec{r}_{BA}$, so
%
\eqn{3}{\vec{r}_{AB} = - \vec{r}_{BA}\,.}

\pcap{2}{c}{Velocity and Acceleration from Relative Position}
Once the relative position has been determined, it is simple to get the
velocity and acceleration of $B$ relative to $A$, just by differentiating
Eq.\,(\eqnno{1}):
%
\TwoEqns{}{\vec{v}_{BA} & = & \fract{d}{dt}(\vec{r}_{BA}) =
  \fract{d}{dt}(\vec{r}_B - \vec{r}_A) =
  \fract{d}{dt}\vec{r}_B - \fract{d}{dt}\vec{r}_A = \vec{v}_B - \vec{v}_A}
          {\vec{a}_{BA} & = & \fract{d}{dt}\vec{v}_{BA} =
  \fract{d}{dt}(\vec{v}_B - \vec{v}_A) =
  \fract{d}{dt}\vec{v}_B - \fract{d}{dt}\vec{v}_A = \vec{a}_B - \vec{a}_A\,,}
so
%
\eqn{4}{\vec{v}_{BA} = \vec{v}_B - \vec{v}_A\,,}
%
\eqn{5}{\vec{a}_{BA} = \vec{a}_B - \vec{a}_A\,.}
%
Notice that the mathematical relationships between $\vec{v}_{BA}$,
$\vec{v}_A$, and $\vec{v}_B$, and between $\vec{a}_{BA}$, $\vec{a}_A$, and
$\vec{a}_B$ are identical to those between $\vec{r}_{BA}$, $\vec{r}_A$,
$\vec{r}_B$.
For example, if you start out having velocity $\vec{v}_A$ (or acceleration
$\vec{a}_A$), give yourself the additional velocity $\vec{v}_{BA}$ (or
acceleration $\vec{a}_{BA}$), you end up having velocity $\vec{v}_B$ (or
acceleration $\vec{a}_B$).

\pcap{2}{d}{Subscript Reversal on $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{a}$}
It is also easy to see that the velocity of $A$ relative to $B$,
$\vec{v}_{AB}$, and the acceleration of $A$ relative to $B$, $\vec{a}_{AB}$,
are related to $\vec{v}_{BA}$ and $\vec{a}_{BA}$ in just the
same way as $\vec{r}_AB$ is related to $\vec{r}_{BA}$:
%
\eqn{6}{\vec{v}_{AB} = - \vec{v}_{BA}\,,}
%
\eqn{7}{\vec{a}_{AB} = - \vec{a}_{BA}\,.}

\pcap{2}{e}{An Example}
As an example of the velocity addition law, Eq.\,(\eqnno{4}), suppose
you are driving down a highway at 45~mph when a state trooper approaches you
from the rear at 65~mph.
If the trooper has a radar gun trained on you, what will it read?
Using Eq.\,(\eqnno{4}), we find the answer to be 20~mph. \help{3}
Perhaps the answer was obvious to you without using Eq.\,(\eqnno{4}).

Now suppose the trooper is traveling along a road that makes an angle with
the road on which you are traveling.
What will the radar gun read then?
Perhaps it is obvious that Eq.\,(\eqnno{4}) is needed in order to
determine the result in this case. \help{4}

\scap{3}{FRAMES OF REFERENCE}

\CaptionAfterFullFramedFigure{Fig.\,2. Relative position vectors defined for
various observer labels where $\vec{r}_{BA}$ is (a) the difference between
two vectors, or (b) the sum of two vectors.}{m11gr02}

\pcap{3}{a}{``Observer'' Labels}
Sometimes it may be easier to deal solely with relative quantities like
$\vec{r}_{AB}$ instead of ``absolute'' ones like $\vec{r}_A$.
To do this, we can simply place an observer $O$ at the origin of the
coordinate system and measure all the vector quantities relative to that
observer.
The coordinate system is called the observer's ``frame of reference.''
Thus $\vec{r}_A$ becomes $\vec{r}_{AO}$, $\vec{v}_A$ becomes $\vec{v}_{AO}$,
and so on (see Fig.\,2a).
Equation\,(\eqnno{1}) then becomes
%
\eqn{8}{\vec{r}_{BA} = \vec{r}_{BO} - \vec{r}_{AO}\,,}
%
or, by applying Eq.\,(\eqnno{3}) to get $\vec{r}_{AO} =
- \vec{r}_{OA}$ (see Fig.\,2b), we have:
%
\eqn{9}{\vec{r}_{BA} = \vec{r}_{OA} + \vec{r}_{BO}\,.}

\pcap{3}{b}{Checking an Equation's Subscript Sequence}
The addition equation, Eq.\,(\eqnno{9}), may be read ``$A$ to $B$ equals $A$
to $O$ plus $O$ to $B$.''
Note that one reads the subscripts from right to left.
This provides a powerful check on the correctness of relative-vector
equations, since it is usually quite easy to rearrange terms into the
addition form.

\pcap{3}{c}{Converting From Other Notations}
Many scientists use a ``prime-unprimed'' notation when describing vectors
relative to two frames of reference.
Vectors in that notation may be converted to double subscript notation by
placing observers (say, $O$ and $O'$) at the origins of the reference frames
and expressing the vector quantities relative to these observers.
For example, consider the ``prime-unprimed'' velocity addition equation
%
\eqn{10}{\vec{v} = \vec{v}' + \vec{u}\,,}
%
where $\vec{v}$ is the velocity of an object in the unprimed reference frame,
$\vec{v}'$ is the velocity of the object in the primed reference frame, and
$\vec{u}$ is the velocity of the primed frame relative to unprimed frame.
Equation\,(\eqnno{10}) can be rewritten as
%
\eqn{11}{\vec{v}_{AO} = \vec{v}_{AO'} + \vec{v}_{O'O}\,,}
%
by making the identifications
%
\ThreeEqns{}{%
\vec{v}  & = & \vec{v}_{AO} = 
                          {\rm velocity\;of\;} A {\rm \;relative\;to\;} O}
{\vec{v}' & = & \vec{v}_{AO'} =
                          {\rm velocity\;of\;} A {\rm\;relative\;to\;}O'}
{\vec{u}  & = & \vec{v}_{O'O} =
                          {\rm velocity\;of\;} O'{\rm \;relative\;to\;} O\,.}
%
The double subscript form is easy to check visually.

******* extra stuff:

\scap{4}{RELATIVE LINEAR MOTION}

\pcap{4}{a}{General Equation of Motion is a Vector Equation}
The equation of motion for a particle is given by the vector relation
\begin{equation}
\vec{a} = \fract{dv}{dt},
\end{equation}\setcounter{eqn12}{\the\value{equation}}
which is actually three component equations expressed in mathematical
shorthand.
Equation (\eqnno{12}) describes the acceleration of an object with
respect to a given frame of reference, or the acceleration of one frame of
reference with respect to another.
In general, to find a given acceleration we must first construct the
corresponding velocity vector, and then differentiate each component of the
velocity.

\pcap{4}{b}{Linear Motion}
If the direction of the velocity is not changing with time, we do not need
to use vector equations.
For such a case the trajectory is a straight line and we can align one of the
coordinate axes with the trajectory.
If we align the $x$-axis with the trajectory, we get this equation:
\begin{equation}
a_x = \fract{dv_x}{dt}.
\end{equation}\setcounter{eqn13}{\the\value{equation}}
Then the magnitude of the acceleration is given by:
\begin{equation}
a = |a_x| = |\fract{dv_x}{dt}| = |\fract{dv}{dt}|
\end{equation}\setcounter{eqn15}{\the\value{equation}}
where $v$ is the magnitude of the vector $v$ and is positive, as vector
magnitudes must be.

\pcap{4}{d}{Relative Motion That is Non-Linear}
Although it is easier to calculate accelerations in the case of relative
linear motion, there are many interesting examples of relative motion in
which the direction of one or more velocity is not constant.
For example, if one of the frames of reference is rotating or revolving,
an observer within this reference frame will perceive the motion of a
particle in a dramatically different manner than will an observer in a
non-rotating reference frame.
This type of relative motion is responsible for such simple effects as the
counter-clockwise motion of a sink drain vortex in the northern hemisphere.
Tornados and cyclones more serious examples of the influence of rotating
frames of reference.%

Rotating Frames of Reference: Effects on the Earth's Surface'' (MISN-0-18).}
