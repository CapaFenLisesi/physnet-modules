\item [1.] See Output Skills K1-K3 in this module's \textit{ID Sheet}.

\item [2.] Suppose you have a twin who is an astronaut.
           The twin travels at speed 0.9999\unit{c} to the vicinity of a star which
           is 60\unit{light years} away from earth (one \unit{light year} is the distance
           light travels in one year).
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] Find your age and your twin's age at the time you observe that your
           twin reaches the star.
\item [b.] Show that the length, time and velocity observed by your twin check.
