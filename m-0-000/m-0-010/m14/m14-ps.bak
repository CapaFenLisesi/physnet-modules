These problems are grouped by skill so that you can easily find the ones
corresponding to the skills for which you are responsible.
The answers are at the end of the list.
The notation ``\help{n}'' refers to panel ``{\it n}'' in part 3
of this module's {\it Special Assistance Supplement}.
Problems 15 and 16 are also on this module's {\it Model Exam}.\smallskip

\begin{two-digit-list}
\item [1.] Forces of 65\,N north and $5.0\times10^1$\,N east are applied to a
2.0\,kg can of soup.
Determine the acceleration of the can. \help{12}

\item [2.]  An $8.0\times10^1$\,kg parachutist is ``falling'' with a downward
acceleration of 1.5\,m/s$^2$.

parachute?

\begin{two-digit-list}
\item [4.]  An $8.0\times10^3$\,kg meteorite slashes through the sky, slams into
the earth at $4.0\times10^2$\,m/s and comes to a stop 16\,m below ground level.
Assuming the meteorite was decelerating uniformly while burrowing through the
ground, what was the magnitude of the net force on it during those times?
\help{5}

\item [5.]  An irate college student on a bicycle is bearing down on a
panic-stricken pedestrian.
At a distance of 6.0\,m from the pedestrian, she slams on her brakes and
slides uniformly to a stop in 1.5\,seconds.
What was magnitude of the average stopping force?
Is the pedestrian bicycle-struck?

was 8.8\,m/s.

per hour (88\,ft/s) in 45 sec.
What is the magnitude of the average force on it? \help{14}

\item [7.] A ``souped-up'' Volkswagon, weighing 2020\,lb., reaches a speed of
45 miles per hour (66\,ft/s) in a distance of 1320 feet after starting from
rest.
What is the magnitude of the average force on the car? \help{14}

\item [8.]  Three forces;

%

Find the mass of the ball. \help{13}

\eqnline{\vec{F}_1 = (3.0 \uvex{x} + 15.0 \uvex{y})\unit{N}}
\eqnline{\vec{F}_2 = (16.0 \uvex{x} - 25.0 \uvex{y})\unit{N}}

\icap{Skill 1c (Problem-Solving):}

\begin{two-digit-list}
\item [11.]  An electron, mass 9.1\,$\times$\,10$^{-31}$\,kg, has an initial

\eqnline{\vec{v}_1 = (3.0\times10^6 \uvex{x} + 2.0\times10^6 \uvex{y} +
0 \uvex{z})\unit{m/s}.}

%
\eqnline{\vec{v}_f = (0 \uvex{x} + 5.0\times10^6 \uvex{y} +
1.0\times10^7 \uvex{z})\unit{m/s}.}

\item [12.] A 5.0\,kg mass has an initial velocity of
$(3.0 \uvex{x} + 6.0 \uvex{y})\unit{m/s}$.
Sixteen seconds later it has a velocity of
$(9.0 \uvex{x} - 9.0 \uvex{y})\unit{m/s}$.

of the force?
