\xpcap{}{A}{One-dimensional Collision-Force Calculation}\newline
Problem: Estimate the average resultant force on a paratrooper (mass = 79\,kg)
who hits the ground falling vertically at a speed of 11\,m/s (25\,mi/hr).
Assume that he is a super-trooper and does not fall when he lands, but just
lets his knees bend to increase the collision time.

\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [1.] The average resultant force on the trooper is
           $\Delta\vec{p}/\Delta t$, where $\Delta\vec{p}$ is his
           change in momentum while stopping and $\Delta t$ is \fl .

\item [2.] $\Delta \vec{p}$ = \fl .

\item [3.] Give a rough estimate for $\Delta t$.
           $\Delta t\,\simeq$\,\fl .

\item [4.] $\vec{F}_{R,av}$ \fl .

\item [5.] How does this force compare to his weight?
           $F/mg$ = \fl .

\item [1.] The time elapsing between the instant of contact with the ground and
the instant his downward motion stops.

\item [2.] $m(\vec{v}_{\rm final} - \vec{v}_{\rm initial}) =
           (79\,{\rm kg}) \cdot (0 - 11\,{\rm m/s,\;down}) =
           869\,{\rm kg\,m/s,\;up}$.

\item [3.] His average speed while stopping will be approximately one-half
           his initial speed; i.e., $v_{av} \simeq 5.5\,$m/s.
           Hence his stopping time will be approximately
           $\Delta t \simeq x/v_{av}$, where $x$ is the distance his ``body''
           travels during the deceleration.
           In a full-knee bend, a body might fall approximately 0.8\,m, so
           $\Delta t \simeq (0.8\,{\rm m})/(5.5\,{\rm m/s}) \simeq 0.1$\,s.

\item [4.] $\Delta \vec{p} /\Delta t \simeq

\xpcap{}{C}{One-dimensional Conservation of Momentum Problem}\newline
Problem: A mass $m$ moving with a speed $w$ to the right collides head-on with
a mass $M$ moving with a speed $V$ to the left.
After the collision, the two masses remain together.
Determine the velocity $u$ of the composite mass in terms of $m$, $M$, $w$,
$V$, and $\hat{x}$, a unit vector to the right.

\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [1.] Read the problem carefully.
           Draw before and after sketches that depict the problem.
           Label the various masses and velocities with appropriate symbols.

\item [2.] Is it appropriate to assume the momentum of the two-particle system
           to be conserved during the collision?
           What assumptions, if any, must be made so that you can use momentum
           conservation?

\item [3.] Assuming momentum to be conserved, write a vector expression which
           relates $m$, $M$, $w$, $V$, $\hat{x}$, and $\vec{u}$.

\item [4.] Solve for $\vec{u}$.
           What can you say about the direction for $\vec{u}$?
           $\vec{u}$ = \fl .

\item [5.] If the magnitude of the momentum of $m$ before the collision is \fl
           than that of $M$, the composite particle moves to the right.
           If the two initial momenta are \fl, the composite particle remains
           at rest; and if the initial momentum of $m$ is \fl that of $M$, the
           final motion is to the left.

\item [6.] Consider the special case for $M$ initially at rest; i.e., $V$ = 0.
           Show how a measurement of the initial and final speeds (w,u) could
           be used to determine the ratio of the two masses.

\item [7.] For the mass determination just discussed, suppose the data shows
           that $u \ll w$.
           Which inequality is appropriate: $M \ll m$ or $M \gg m$?

\item [8.] If you did not do so already, write a brief discussion explaining
           these results by considering the known results of collisions
           between small and large objects.

\xpcap{}{}{Answers}
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [1.] \LeftEpsFigure{6.3cm}{2.0cm}{}{m15gr10}
           Notice that in the sketch we have presumed the composite particle to
           be moving to the right after the collision.
           Can you, in fact, determine the final direction of motion from what
           you are given?
           You will see shortly.

\item [2.] Since the stated problem makes no comment as to whether the
           two-particle system is isolated, you have no assurance that the
           system momentum is not changing.
           However, if we assume the time of the collision to be sufficiently
           short, then any momentum change by external forces will be
           negligible; and momentum conservation can then be used to relate
           momenta immediately before and after the collision.
           In any laboratory situation, the validity of such an assumption
           must always be considered carefully.

\item [3.] $m w \hat{x} - M V \hat{x} = (m + M) \vec{u}$.

           Did you miss the sign on the $MV$ term?

           Don't forget it's moving in the negative $\hat{x}$ direction.

\item [4.] $\left(m w - M V/ m + M\right) \hat{x}$.

           If $m w > M V$, $\vec{u}$ is in the $\hat{x}$ direction.

           If $m w = M V$, $\vec{u}$ is zero.

           If $m w < M V$, $\vec{u}$ is in the negative $\hat{x}$ direction.

\item [5.] greater than, equal in magnitude, less than.

\item [6.] If $V = 0$, $m w = (m + M) u$; or $m(w - u) = M u$ and
           $M/m = (w - u)/u$.

\item [7.] $\frac{\ds M}{\ds m} =
           \frac{\ds w - u}{\ds u} \simeq \frac{\ds w}{\ds u} \gg 1$;
           or $M \gg m$?

\item [8.] If the two move off very slowly after the collision ($U \ll w$),
           then $m$ must have collided with a much larger mass; e.g., a ping
           pong ball colliding with a locomotive at rest imparts verrrry little
           speed to the locomotive $\ldots$ even on frictionless tracks!
           On the other hand, if an at-rest mass M were much smaller than an
           incoming mass $m$, the collision would have little effect on the
           speed of $m$.
           (Now you give the appropriate ping pong ball-locomotive analogy).

\begin{two-digit-list}
\item [1.]  Read the problem carefully.
            Consider the two particle system consisting of $m$ and $M$.
            Is this an isolated system?
            Why?

\item [2.]  If you see momentum conservation to relate the known and unknown
            quantities, what assumptions about the system are you making?

\item [3.]  Under what condition is this assumption valid, even if the system
            is not isolated?

\item [4.]  Construct a vector diagram illustrating the momentum conservation
            equation: $m \vec{u} = m \vec{w} + M \vec{V}$.

\item [5.]  \ItemFigure{The task now is to use this vector diagram to solve
            for $w$ and $V$ in terms of the known quantities $m$, $M$, $u$,

            Solutions are easily obtained by using the law of sines.
            Write out this relationship for the triangle shown.}{m15gr12}

\item [6.]  Now use this result to solve for $w$.
            Hint: Recall that $\sin(\pi - \alpha) = \sin\alpha$ for any value
            of $\alpha$.

\item [7.]  Solve for $V$.

\item [8.]  \ItemFigure{You could have solved for $w$ and $V$ by writing
            down conservation of momentum equations.

            components parallel to initial momentum:\,$m u$ = ?

            components perpendicular to initial momentum:\,0 = ?

\item [9.]  Use the second equation to solve for MV in terms of m, w, $\theta$,
            $\phi$.
            Substitute this into the first, and solve the resulting equation
            for $w$.
            Your answer will simplify if you use the trig identity:

            $\sin(\theta + \phi) = \sin\theta\,\cos\phi + \cos\theta\,\sin\phi$.

\item [10.] Now complete the solution by substituting the expression for $w$
            into the equation for $V$.

\item [11.] Note that the expressions for $w$ and $V$ obtained by two alternate
            means agrees.
            Now determine the values for $w$ and $V$.

\item [12.] \ItemFigure{Notice that the vector triangle drawn to display
            conservation of momentum graphically was very important in solving

           and vice versa.

\item [3.] If the collision time is sufficiently short, then external forces

\end{one-digit-list}

\item [3.] $\vec{F} = d\vec{P}/dt$ may be written in scalar form as:

           $F_x = dP_x/dt$, \hs $F_y = dP_y/dt$, \hs $F_z = dP_z/dr$.

           Given $F_x = F_z = 0$, then $dP_x/dt = dP_z/dt = 0$ so
           $P_x$ and $P_z$ remain constant.

\item [4.] By letting the gloved hand move with the ball, he increases the
           ``collision time'' required to change the ball's momentum to zero,
           thereby reducing the average force on the ball, and hence (by
           Newton's third law) reducing the average force on his hand.

\item [e.] No.
           It exerts a horizontal force on the ball.
           A frictionless surface can exert normal forces only.
\end{one-digit-list}

\item [6.] For most collisions the collision time is so small and consequently
           the collision forces so large, that the effect of external forces
           can be neglected.
