{The problem of finding \m{\theta}:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item [1.] Draw the road surface and the horizontal line exactly as in the
            sketch that accompanies the statement of the problem.
 \item [2.] Drop a vertical line from the upper end of the road surface you
            have drawn until the vertical line reaches the horizontal line.
            You have in front of you a right-angle triangle which has three sides.
 \item [3.] Now mark the \Quote{5\unit{feet}} and the \Quote{100\unit{feet}} mentioned in the
            problem on the correct two sides of the triangle (pay close attention to
            the way those two numbers are described in the statement of the problem).
 \item [4.] Mark \Quote{\m{\theta}} on the correct angle in the triangle.
 \item [5.] Now, knowing two sides of a right-angle triangle, you can find the angle.
            If you don't know how, see the trigonometry review in \Quote{Review of Basic
            Mathematical Skills} (MISN-0-401).
 \end{itemize}

\AsItem{2}{PS-problem~4d}
{Look back at answer 4c and:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item [1.] Solve the second equation for \m{N}.
 \item [2.] Put that solution for \m{N} into the third equation wherever \m{N}
            occurs and then solve the resulting equation for \m{f}.
 \item [3.] Put that solution for \m{f} into the first equation wherever \m{f}
            occurs and then solve the resulting equation for \m{p}.
 \end{itemize}
