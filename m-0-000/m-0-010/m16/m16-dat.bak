    \begin{RuleApplicationSkills}
    \item [R1.] Interpret the starting and stopping of motion of given objects such
    as walking persons, cars, bicycles, boats, and planes in terms of Newton's
    three laws and forces of non-sliding and sliding friction.

    \begin{ProblemSolvingSkills}
    \item [S1.] Given sufficient information on one or more masses, possibly
    connected, possibly on inclines, possibly with zero or non-zero non-sliding
    and/or sliding coefficients of friction, and possibly with constant applied
    forces, solve for requested values of forces, masses, coefficients of friction,
    and kinematic variables.
