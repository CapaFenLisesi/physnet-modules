\begin{InputSkills}
\item [1.]  Determine the direction and magnitude of the vector (cross) product of
two given vectors \prrqone{0-2}.
\item [2.]  State the vector relationships between velocity, angular velocity,
position, and force for an object in uniform circular motion \prrqone{0-17}.
\item [3.]  Transform velocities between different Galilean frames of reference and
use double-subscript object-observer notation \prrqone{0-11}.
\end{InputSkills}

\begin{KnowledgeSkills}
\item [K1.] Derive the Coriolis and centrifugal accelerations, starting with the
expression which relates a vector's time derivative in a rotating reference
frame to the time derivative in a non-rotating reference frame.
\item [K2.] Derive the rotational directions of winds near high and low pressure
centers in the northern and southern hemispheres.
\item [K3.] Explain the alternating prevailing east-west wind directions found as one
moves in a north-south direction on the face of the earth.
\item [K4.] Explain (qualitatively) the reason for the apparent rotation of the plane
of a Foucault pendulum, and explain how observations of it prove that the
earth rotates.
\item [K5.] Demonstrate the Coriolis force using a rotating stool and show that, in
all cases, the direction of the force is as given by the algebraic formula.
