    \begin{KnowledgeSkills}
    \item [K1.] Neglecting air resistance derive the velocity of a vertically
    rising rocket, which has a high constant burn rate, as a
    function of time and as a function of fuel consumption.
    %
    \item [K2.] Show that gravity can be neglected for the above case during
    the burn.
    %
    \item [K3.] Show that two rocket stages are more efficient than one.
    \end{KnowledgeSkills}

    \begin{ProblemSolvingSkills}
    \item [S2.] Show that the equations found in Kl agree qualitatively and
    within given limits with what one would expect.
