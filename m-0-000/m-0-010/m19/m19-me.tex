\item [l.] See Output Skills K1-K3 on this module's \textit{ID Sheet}.

\item [2.] The earth escape velocity, 25,000\unit{mph}, is the upward velocity needed
           at the surface of the earth for eventual escape from the earth's
           gravitational pull.
           If the maximum fraction of a rocket's mass that can be devoted to
           fuel is 90\%, determine the minimum exhaust velocity necessary for
           the rocket to reach escape velocity.

\item [3.] Show that the equation developed in Problem l above agrees with what
           one would expect if \m{t} is set equal to the initial time, \m{t}.
