\begin{InputSkills}
\item [1.] Define the integral; evaluate integrals of elementary functions
\prrqone{0-1}.
\item [2.] Define the scalar product of two vectors and express it in
component form \prrqone{0-2}.

\end{InputSkills}

\begin{KnowledgeSkills}
\item [K1.] Vocabulary: watt.
\item [K2.] State the line integral definition of the work done by a force
and explain how it reduces to other mathematical formulations for special
cases.
\item [K3.] Define the power developed by an agent exerting a force.
\item [K4.] Derive the Work-Kinetic Energy Relation using Newton's second
law and the work done by a variable force.
\item [K5.] Define the kinetic energy of a particle.
\end{KnowledgeSkills}

\begin{ProblemSolvingSkills}
\item [S1.] Calculate the work done on an object given either:
\begin{itemize}
\item [a.] one or more constant forces, or
\item [b.] a force that is a function of position along a prescribed path.
\end{itemize}
\item [S2.] Use the definition of power to solve problems involving agents
exerting constant forces on objects moving with constant velocity.
\item [S3.] Use the Work-Kinetic Energy Relation to solve problems involving
the motion of particles.
