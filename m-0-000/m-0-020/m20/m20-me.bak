\item [1.] See Output Skills K1-K4 in this module's {\it ID Sheet}.
One or more, or none, of these skills may be on the actual exam.

\item [2.] \UnframedEpsFigure{m20gr13}{A constant horizontal force $\vec{F}$ pushes an
object of mass $M$ up a frictionless incline which makes an angle $\theta$
with the horizontal.}
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] Starting with the object midway {\it up} the incline, moving the
speed of $v_0$ directed up along the incline, use the work-kinetic energy
relation to find the velocity of the object when it's at a point a distance
$D$ further up the incline.
\item [b.] If at this same starting point as in part (a) the object started
with the speed $v_0$ directed {\it down} along the incline (same forces
acting as before), use the work-kinetic energy relation to find the velocity
of the object when it's at the point a distance $D$ further up the incline.
\item [c.] Explain the relation between your answers to parts (a) and (b).
What is the difference in the overall motion between the two cases?
\end{one-digit-list}

\item [3.] The gravitational force on an object of mass $m$ which is at or
above the surface of the earth, say at a total distance $r$ from the center of
the earth, has a magnitude $Km/r^2$ and is directed toward the center of the
earth.
Here $K$ is a constant equal to $3.99 \times 10^{14}$\,m$^3$/s$^2$.
Hence the force is not constant but diminishes the farther the object is
from the earth's center.
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] At the surface of the earth, recall from previous knowledge that
this force is $mg$.
With this knowledge of the force at the surface of the earth and with $K$
given above, determine the radius of the earth.
\item [b.] What is the minimum amount of work that you must do (energy you must
expend) in order to move an object of mass $m$ radially outward from the
surface of the earth to a distance $r$ from the center of the earth
($r > R_e$)?
(HINT: What's the {\it minimum} force you must exert?
That determines the {\it minimum} work).
\item [c.] From this result, calculate how much energy it takes to move a
person of mass 65 kilograms from the surface of the earth to an infinite
distance away (disregard gravity forces other than from the earth).
\end{one-digit-list}

\item [4.] Suppose a car engine is delivering $1.60 \times 10^2$\,hp at a
continuous rate, keeping the car at 25\,m/s (56\,mph).
Determine the force the engine is overcoming.
