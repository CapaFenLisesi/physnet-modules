\noindent Note: If you have trouble with a problem, see the activities in the
\textit{Special Assistance Supplement}.
If there is a \textit{help} reference, it also is in the \textit{Special Assistance
Supplement}.

\noindent In all problems involving the calculation of \textit{work}, you should
start with the line-integral definition and show how it can be applied and
simplified for the particular situation.

Take \m{g = 9.8\unit{m/s\up{2}}}, 1\,HP = 550\unit{ft\,lb/sec} = 746\unit{watts}.
