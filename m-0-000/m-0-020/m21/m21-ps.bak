\noindent Problems 20-22 are also in this module's {\it Model Exam}.

\begin{two-digit-list}
\item [1.] In the example of Sect.\,5b in the text, we found that 175\,J of
energy was converted to heat and breaking of chemical bonds, primarily in
your toe.
If it requires an average of $10^{-18}$\,J to break one molecular bond and
4/7 of the ``lost'' energy went into breaking molecular bonds, how many
bonds were broken?*(C)

\item [2.] The useful output power from a certain water pump is 80.0\% of
the electrical power supplied to it.
This pump is used to raise 4.0\,kg/s of water from a well.
If the water leaves the system at a speed of 8.0\,m/s at a height of 12.0\,m
above the water level in the well, find the electrical power being supplied
to the pump.*(G) \help{24}

\item [3.] The high-dive at an Olympic swimming pool is 10.0\,m (32.8\,ft)
above water level.

or she starts with a speed of 5.0\,m/s at an angle of 36.87$\degrees$ above
the horizontal?*(A) \help{25}

\item [4.] A girl of mass 49.0\,kg is on a swing which has a mass of
1.0\,kg.
Suppose you pull her back until her center of mass is 2.0\,m above the
ground.
You let her go and she swings out and returns to the same point.
Are all forces acting on the system conservative?
(Caution: this question deserves a carefully qualified answer.) (B)

\item [5.] Assume that all forces in the previous problem are conservative,
and that the center of mass of the girl-plus-swing system is 0.75\,m off the
ground at its lowest point.
Find the girl's maximum speed.*(H)

\item [6.] Suppose you push the girl in problem 5 and add 490\,J of energy
to the system.
Find her new maximum height above the ground.*(D)

\item [7.] A certain toboggan with its riders has a mass of 305\,kg and goes
down a hill which is 25\,m high.
The toboggan starts from rest and attains a final speed at the bottom of the
hill of 12\,m/s.
Find the energy lost to friction.*(J)

\item [8.] One bit of advice that bowlers often hear is ``let the weight of
the ball do the work.
Don't force it.''
For each of the following two cases, find the percentage of the ball's final
energy which is supplied by the bowler:*\help{26}
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] Good bowler, average = 200, backswing height = 1.10\,m, release
speed = 6.76\,m/s. (E)
\item [b.] Average bowler, average = 120, backswing height = 0.70\,m,
release speed = 7.70\,m/s. (E)

{\em Biomechanics IV}, 1974.
\end{one-digit-list}

\item [9.] A rubber ball is dropped from a height of 1.5\,m onto a concrete
floor and rebounds to a height of 1.2\,m.
What fraction of its original energy was lost to friction?*(K)

\item [10.] Given a conservative force defined by $\vec{F} =
- k x^2 \hat{x}$ find the corresponding potential energy function.
State the reference point. (F)

\item [11.] Given a conservative force, $\vec{F} = k/r^3 \hat{r}$, find the
associated potential energy function.
State the reference point. (I)

\item [12.] Given the conservative force $\vec{F} = x y_0 \hat{x}$ find the
associated potential energy function.
State the reference point. (M)

\item [13.] Given the conservative force, $\vec{F} = A \cos x\,\hat{x}$,
find the potential energy function.
State the reference point. (N)

\item [14.] A man at the scene of an accident claims that he was traveling
on a level road at 25\,m/s (56\,mph) when he saw the car pull out in front
of him.
He says he skidded for about 30\,m and hit the other car with a
speed of about 5\,m/s.
If he is telling the truth, what was the coefficient of friction, assuming
it to be independent of speed? (L) \help{27}

\item [15.] A car with a mass of 1500\,kg accelerates from rest to a speed
of 21\,m/s in a time of 8.0\,s.
Neglecting losses due to friction and assuming a level road, what horsepower
is required?
(hp = 746\,W) (O)

\item [16.] Re-do the previous problem for the car on a hilly road if its
increase in height is 8\,m.*(Q)

\item [17.] A 40.0\,kg mass is traveling horizontally with velocity
2.0\,$\hat{x}$\,m/s as it crosses the coordinate origin and encounters the
force $\vec{F} = - k x \hat{x}$ due to a spring.
If $k = 250$\,N/m, at what value of $x$ will the mass stop?*(R) \help{28}

\item [18.] A system consists of particles $A$ and $B$ with masses 11\,kg
and 21\,kg respectively.
At time zero: $A$ has a velocity of (5.0\,m/s, east) at height $h = 0.0$.
$B$ has a velocity of (4.0\,m/s at 23$^\circ$ north of east) and
$h = 2.0$\,m.
One hour later: $A$ is at rest at $h = 3.0$\,m.
$B$ has a velocity of (8.0\,m/s, north) at $h = 0.0$.
Find the net work done on the system during the hour.*(P) \help{29}

\item [19.] How many times could a 72\,kg person climb the Empire State
Building while using up $2.0 \times 10^3$ food calories of energy, if her or
his body were 100\% efficient in turning food energy into useful mechanical
energy?
The Empire State Building is 381\,m high, and a food calorie = 4186\,J. (S)
(It should be clear from the answer to this problem that very little of the
body's energy is converted into useful mechanical energy.
Most of it goes into heat.)

\item [20.] A nonconstant force, $F$, directed vertically upward (the force
varies in magnitude as some unknown function of altitude) is exerted on an
object of mass $m$.
Under the action of this force, the object moves straight up from ground
level to a distance $h$, above the ground.
It starts at rest and when it gets to height $h$ it is moving with speed $v$
upward.

dropping a mass onto it.
The mass, $m$, is released a distance $y_0$ above the head of the nail and
drives the nail an additional distance $s$ into the board.
Neglect the mass of the nail.

gun with a speed of $5.0 \times 10^1$\,m/s.

38\,m/s, what percentage of its original energy was lost (to friction with
the air) by the shell in its flight? (AG)
