    \item [S1.] Given the potential energy of a particle as a function of position
    (in one dimension or radially with spherical symmetry) determine (for a given
    position) the force acting on that particle and its acceleration, velocity,
    and turning points (if any).
    \item [S2.] Given the graph of a one-dimensional potential energy function and the
    total energy of a particle, give a qualitative description of the motion of
    this particle and locate its turning points and regions of acceleration and
    deceleration.
