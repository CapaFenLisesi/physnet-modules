\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [1.] See Output Skills (Knowledge) on this unit's {\em ID Sheet}.

\item [2.] An object of mass 1.0\unit{kg} is moving with SHM, with an amplitude of
0.010\,m, an angular frequency of \m{4\pi\unit{rad/s}}, and a maximum displacement
at time zero.
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item[a.] Write down the kinematical expression for the displacement as a
function of time.
\item[b.] Find the displacement, velocity, potential energy and kinetic energy
at a time 3/8 of a period past a time when \m{x = 0.010\unit{m}}.
\item[c.] Sketch the displacement and potential energy versus time on a graph.
\item[d.] Use the above sketch to describe how the velocity changes as
position changes through a cycle.
