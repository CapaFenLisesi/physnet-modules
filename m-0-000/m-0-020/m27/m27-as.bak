{Either a sine or a cosine function can be use to represent the displacement
 of the harmonic oscillator, with an appropriate initial phase for each case,
 i.e.
 %
 \eqn{}{x = A\,\sin(\omega t + \alpha)}%
 %
 or
 %
 \eqn{}{x = A\,\cos(\omega t + \alpha')}%
 %
 where
 %
 \eqn{}{\alpha' = \alpha + \fract{\pi}{2}.}%
 %
 How does this choice of a harmonic function determine which axis
 (the positive $x$-axis or the negative $y$-axis) is chosen as the reference
 for the phase angle?
