\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [1.] A harmonic oscillator of mass 0.64\,kg has a
displacement from equilibrium given by:
%
\eqn{}{x = (2.1\unit{m})\,\cos{[(1.25/\unit{s})t + (\pi/4)]}\,.}
%
\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] Draw a phasor diagram showing the displacement, velocity, and
acceleration phasors of the oscillator, and the phasor representing the
restoring force acting on it, at time $t = 0$.
\item [b.] Draw another phasor diagram of the four phasors at time
$t = 1.0$\,s.
Describe how the phasor diagram changes during the time interval between
$t =0$ and $t = 1.0$\,s.
\end{one-digit-list}

\item [2.] Draw a phasor diagram showing the displacement, velocity,
acceleration and restoring force phasors at $t = P/2$ where $P$ is period for
the case:
%
\eqn{}{x(t) = A\,\cos{[(\pi/s)t + \pi/2)]}\,.}
%
Also, show the total phase and mark its value.

\begin{one-digit-list}
\item [a.] $|\vec{x}*|$\,=\,1.5\,m,
\item [  ] $|\vec{v}*|$\,=\,1.9\,m/s,
\item [  ] $|\vec{a}*|$\,=\,2.3\,m/s$^2$,
\item [  ] $|\vec{F}*|$\,=\,1.5\,N.
\item [b.] The four phasors maintain their directions relative to one another,
and all rotate counter-clockwise with an angular speed of 72 degrees per
second.

\item [2.] The total phase is: $\omega t + \alpha = 270\degrees$ at
$t = P/2$.
