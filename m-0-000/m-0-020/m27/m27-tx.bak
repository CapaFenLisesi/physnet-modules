This figure shows the phase relationships among various quantities associated
with a harmonic oscillator whose displacement is given by

would have exactly the same effect as subtracting a constant ninety degrees
from the cosine phase. \help{1}}

$x(t)\,=\,A\,\cos{(\omega t\,+\,\alpha)}$, where $\alpha$ is the ``initial
phase.''
The rotating vectors are called ``phasors'' and do not, as vectors, correspond
to any real quantity.
That is why they are marked with asterisks.
The $y*$-axis is an artificial construct and is not to be confused with an
axis in a physical space.
Here the $x$-axis is the real line of motion of the oscillator.

\pcap{1}{b}{Answer these questions}
From the readings, determine:
\begin{itemize}
\item [1.] Which are real, the phasors or their projections along the $x$-axis?
\item [2.] What do the lengths of the phasors signify?
\item [3.] What do the directions of the phasors signify?
\item [4.] Which way do the phasors rotate, clockwise or counter-clockwise?
\item [5.] Why is the velocity phasor drawn ninety degrees ``ahead'' of the
displacement phasor rather than ninety degrees ``behind'' it?
\item [6.] Are the phasors all locked together, or do some rotate faster than others?
\item [7.] At what angular velocity do the phasors rotate?
\item [8.] How can you tell from the form of $x(t)$ that the phase angle should
be measured counter-clockwise, from the positive $x$-axis to the
$\vec{x}*$-phasor?
